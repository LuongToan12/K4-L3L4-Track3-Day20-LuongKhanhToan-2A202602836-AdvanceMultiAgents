description: When fixing defects in a Python package and the task requires type hints, regression tests, and changelog entries.
---
- Run the existing test suite before editing and record the baseline result.
- Never modify or delete existing files under tests/; only add new test files when explicitly allowed.
- For each bug fixed, add one dedicated regression test under tests/ (e.g., tests/test_regressions.py); minimum one test per bug.
- Make each regression test fail on the original code and pass after the fix.
- Add type annotations to every public function (name not starting with '_') in the package: all parameters and the return value.
- Update the root CHANGELOG.md under '## Unreleased' with one bullet per fix: `- fix(<function name>): <short description>`.
- Run the full test suite after changes and confirm existing tests were not modified.
- Fix logic to match docstrings/spec instead of hardcoding expected outputs.
